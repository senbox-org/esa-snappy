SNAP-Jython
===========

This snap-jython module allows for extending SNAP using Jython, the Java implementation of Python.
This module has been removed from the default SNAP installation with version 8.0 and is now provided 
as a separate plugin.
We don't encourage users to rely on this plugin. Jython only supports Python 2.7 and it seems that this will not change.

However, a brief guide on the [Jython Approach](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/549355534/Jython+Approach) exists in the SNAP Wiki.
